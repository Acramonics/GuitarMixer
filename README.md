AEGM: Acoustic/Electric Guitar Mixer
====================================

**Andrew Martin (c) 2025 - 2026**

**Still not working properly yet**

**V1.3 has switched to a dual rail power supply to save the effort of
  biasing all the op amp inputs. Awaiting the new boards**

*AEGM* is designed as a simple 2-channel mixer for guitars like the
PRS range that have both acoustic (piezo) and coil pickups. The
guitars have a combined output, but it doesn't work that well since
the piezo output needs a higher impedance than a standard guitar amp
to work well and your options for balancing the volumes are limited.
Also, you cannot use a pedal on the coil output without also putting
it on the piezo output.

The guitar gives you the option of using two separate outputs which is
fine if you have two amps, but this little mixer is designed to allow
you to use the two outputs separately and then send them to a single
amp.

**V1.2 was simulated in KiCad-Spice and appeared to be working
  properly, but when built was overlayed with noise and distorted.**
