AEGM: Acoustic/Electric Guitar Mixer
====================================

** Andrew Martin (c) 2025 **

*Note: the current version works, but has various problems including a
 very low level on the coil input and bad distortion.*

*Contributions/suggestions welcome, or wait for V1.0!*

*AEGM* is designed as a simple 2-channel mixer for guitars like the
PRS range that have both acoustic (piezo) and coil pickups. The
guitars have a combined output, but it doesn't work that well since
the piezo output needs a higher impedance than a standard guitar amp
to work well and your options for balancing the volumes are limited.
Also, you cannot use a pedal on the coil output without also putting
it on the piezo output.

The guitar gives you the option of using two separate outputs which is
fine if you have two amps, but this little mixer is designed to allow
you to use the two outputs separately and then send them to a single
amp.
